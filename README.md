Implementation of task is in repo, here I will only answer next question from task: 

3. Add recommendations on how to make this task more challenging

I have two suggestions: 
-  Time Zone Awareness (agency.txt): Because if you app is running on server which is not in same time zone that tranport data is used you have problems. 

- Support service days and holidays: I found out that in gtfs days can be longer than 24:00 :) so implemented in code with minutes. But better solution would be using calendar.txt and calendar_dates.txt for edge cases.
